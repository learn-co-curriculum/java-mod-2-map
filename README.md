# Map

## Learning Goals

- Understand the Map interface.
- Review the commonly used methods of the HashMap.
- Discuss iterating over a HashMap.

## Map Interface

While Lists are ordered collections of items that are referenced by their
position in the list, **maps** are lists of what are known as "key/value" pairs,
where a specific "key" is mapped to a specific "value". Duplicate keys are not
allowed and a key can only map to one value.

## Map Implementations

Like the `Collection` interface, the `Map` interface has multiple
implementations that focus on different aspects of maps. The following are the
most commonly used implementations:

1. `HashMap`: permits null keys and null values, and makes no guarantee on the
   order of the elements - this is the implementation we will focus on in this
   section.
2. `LinkedHashMap`: is like a `HashMap` except it maintains the order in 
   which the items are inserted. We will talk more about this type of map in
   a later module.
3. `TreeMap`: is a sorted map, based on the natural ordering of the keys (or
   based on a custom sort). Like the `LinkedHashMap`, this implementation of the
   map interface is beyond the scope of this lesson and will be covered in depth
   in a later module.

## HashMap in Action

Consider we have a list of students, and we want to keep track of their letter
grade in a specific class. Instead of keeping up with two lists, one for the
students and one for their grades, we can instead make use of the `Map`
interface! We can make the key the student's name and our value the student's
letter grade:

```java
Map<String, Character> studentGrades = new HashMap<String, Character>();
```

To use the `Map` interface and the `HashMap` class, we will need to import them
from the `java.util` package:

```java
import java.util.Map;
import java.util.HashMap;

public class MapExample {
   public static void main(String[] args) {
      Map<String, Character> studentGrades = new HashMap<String, Character>();
      studentGrades.put("Dustin", 'B');
      studentGrades.put("Suzie", 'A');
      studentGrades.put("Mike", 'C');

      System.out.println(studentGrades.get("Dustin"));
      System.out.println(studentGrades.get("Suzie"));
      System.out.println(studentGrades.get("Mike"));
   }
}
```

We can add key/value pairs to our `Map` by using the `put()` method which takes
two parameters - the key object and the value object. We can access the value of
the items in our list by using the `get()` method, which takes the key object as
its parameter.

### HashMap Constructors

Another way we could have written the above example is to define the map as a
`HashMap` from the start like so:

```java
HashMap<String, Character> studentGrades = new HashMap<String, Character>();
```

Just like the  `ArrayList` and `HashSet`, if we have an estimate of how many
items will be in the `HashMap`, then we can specify the initial capacity like
so:

```java
HashMap<String, Character> studentGrades = new HashMap<String, Character>(3);
```

If we know some key/pair values when we are initializing the `HashMap`,
we could even construct it like this:

```java
import java.util.Map;
import java.util.HashMap;

public class MapExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        HashMap<String, Character> studentGrades = new HashMap<String, Character>(
            Map.ofEntries(Map.entry("Dustin", 'B'),
                   Map.entry("Suzie", 'A'),
                   Map.entry("Mike", 'C')
            )        
         );
        System.out.println(studentGrades.get("Dustin"));
        System.out.println(studentGrades.get("Suzie"));
        System.out.println(studentGrades.get("Mike"));
    }
}
```

## Commonly Used Methods

Here are the key methods of the `HashMap` class:

| Method                        | Return Type                                                                               | Description                                         |
|-------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| `put(Key key, Value value)`   | value previously associated with the key, or null if there was no mapping for the key     | Adds or Updates a key/value pair to the map         |
| `get(Key key)`                | value of the given key, or null if the map does not contain the given key                 | Gets a value from a map based on its key            |
| `remove(Key key)`             | value that is removed at the given key, or null if the map does not contain the given key | Removes a key/value pair from a map                 |
| `size()`                      | int                                                                                       | Gets the current size of the map                    |
| `contains(Key key)`           | boolean                                                                                   | Checks to see if a map contains a specific key      |
| `contains(Value value)`       | boolean                                                                                   | Checks to see if a map contains a specific value    |
| `isEmpty()`                   | boolean                                                                                   | Checks to see if a list is empty or has a size of 0 |
| `keyset()`                    | set of keys                                                                               | Gets a set of the keys in the current map           |
| `values()`                    | collection of values                                                                      | Gets a collection of values in the current map      |
| `entry(Key key, Value value)` | map entry                                                                                 | Converts the key/value pair into a Map.Entry        |

## Iterating Through a Map

In the last method, we saw something called `Map.Entry` and we saw the `entry()`
method used when constructing the last `HashMap`... but what is a `Map.Entry`?
`Map.Entry` is another interface that refers to the key/pair value from
an entry set. An entry set is a `Set` of all the mappings contained in a `Map`.
To get an entry set from a `Map`, we can call the `entrySet()`
method:

```java
Set<Map.Entry<String, Character>> studentGradeSet = studentGrades.entrySet();
```

Since our `Map` is now converted into a `Set`, which is just a special
kind of `List`, we can iterate through a `Map` like so:

```java
import java.util.Map;
import java.util.HashMap;

public class Example {
   public static void main(String[] args) {
      HashMap<String, Character> studentGrades = new HashMap<String, Character>();

      studentGrades.put("Dustin", 'B');
      studentGrades.put("Suzie", 'A');
      studentGrades.put("Mike", 'C');

      for (Map.Entry<String, Character> studentGrade : studentGrades.entrySet()) {
         System.out.println(studentGrade.getKey() + "'s grade is " + studentGrade.getValue());
      }
   }
}
```

Now that we are in a `for` loop, we can easily get each map entry's key and
value. We may notice that we can use the methods `getKey()` and `getValue()`
which will return the key and the value for each of our map entries.

The above code may then output the following:

```plaintext
Mike's grade is C
Dustin's grade is B
Suzie's grade is A
```

Remember, since a `HashMap` is unordered, we may not iterate through the map
the same way we entered the key/value pairs.
